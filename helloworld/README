Run this at omegaml.io
----------------------

1. Create a free trial account at https://omegaml.io

2. In your local Python environment install the omega|ml client and
   checkout this repository

   $ pip install omegaml[all-client]
   $ git clone https://github.com/omegaml/apps.git

   Note you can avoid installing your own Python environment and just
   run git clone by using omega|ml's hosted JupyterLab environment at
   https://hub.omegaml.io:8888/

3. Deploy the script in your account

   $ om cloud login <user> <apikey>
   $ om scripts put ./helloworld apps/helloworld

   then go to https://hub.omegaml.io/apps/restart/<user>/helloworld to
   see the app is running ok (give it a few minutes to start)

   This builds a pip-installable package, stores it in omega|ml's scripts store
   and deploys it as a scalable kubernetes pod deployment.

Note for development purpose you can modify and run the app locally:

    $ python helloworld/app.py
    => open at http://localhost:5000

    Note even your run this locally, it will use your account's omega|ml runtime
    cloud-hosted environment and storage. To run a local instance of omega|ml
    simply remove the config.yml (created by the $ om login command above) and
    run omega|ml using the docker-compose file provided at https://github.com/omegaml/omegaml
